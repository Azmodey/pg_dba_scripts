## pg_dba_scripts - PostgreSQL DBA scripts

A collection of shell scripts for PostgreSQL database administrator (DBA). Tested on PostgreSQL versions 9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13 under CentOS 7 and Debian 10.

#### [scripts/pg_database_activity.sh](#pg_database_activity). PostgreSQL monitoring script, all information is displayed on one page. 
- Displays PostgreSQL version and status (Master / Replica), hostname and IP address, CPU and Disks load.
- Shows the sizes of the main PostgreSQL directories, archived logs and free disk space, swap usage.
- Displays memory consumption by PostgreSQL processes, statistics on databases, waits and locks, archive and replication statuses.
- When activities occur in PostgreSQL, the progress of operations is displayed: vacuum, vacuum full or cluster, index creation, analyze, pg_basebackup.
- At the end, the last entries of the PostgreSQL log file are displayed.
- For ease of perception, information is displayed in color.

[scripts/pg_database_activity_refresh.sh](#pg_database_activity). Fast refresh of the **pg_database_activity.sh** script every 5 seconds.


#### [scripts/pg_database_information.sh](#pg_database_information). PostgreSQL information script, single tape with the current status of a group of PostgreSQL servers.
The script allows you to quickly find out what the servers are doing and see the exact data for logical replication and external tables. 
- Displays server time and lag time, hostname and IP address, PostgreSQL version and status (Master / Replica), data checksums.
- Statistics are also displayed on databases, waits and locks, archive and replication statuses.
- For logical replication, information about publications and subscriptions in the target databases is displayed.
- Displays information about external servers, associated with them by users and tables.
- Blocked sessions and a tree with their locks are displayed, as well as a list of long-running requests.
- When activities occur in PostgreSQL, the progress of operations is displayed: vacuum, vacuum full or cluster, index creation, analyze, pg_basebackup.


#### Small scripts to manage PostgreSQL:
- [scripts/pg_database_hugepages.sh](#pg_database_hugepages). Shows free and used memory in the system, Transparent Huge Pages (THP) status, current usage of HugePages and recommended settings for PostgreSQL.
- [scripts/pg_database_start.sh](#pg_database_start). Start PostgreSQL, confirmation is required.
- [scripts/pg_database_stop.sh](#pg_database_stop). Stop PostgreSQL, confirmation is required.
- [scripts/pg_database_status.sh](#pg_database_status). PostgreSQL status. Additionally, PostgreSQL processes and replication services are displayed.
- [scripts/pg_database_reload_conf.sh](#pg_database_reload_conf). Reloads PostgreSQL configuration files (postgresql.conf, postgresql.auto.conf, pg_hba.conf, pg_ident.conf), displays records related to changes from the log file. If the changed parameter requires a restart, its characteristics are displayed. Operation confirmation is required.
- [scripts/pg_database_logs.sh](#pg_database_logs). Shows the PostgreSQL log file with auto-update. The log file is selected automatically.
- [scripts/settings.txt](#Setup). General settings for all scripts. Required before starting work.


## Installation

As user **postgres**, download the latest version of the scripts collection (see [Releases](https://github.com/Azmodey/pg_dba_scripts/releases) page):
```
# sudo su - postgres
$ wget https://github.com/Azmodey/pg_dba_scripts/archive/1.8.0.tar.gz
```

Extract script files to separate directory (for example **~scripts/**) and grant the necessary execution rights:
```
$ tar xvzf 1.8.0.tar.gz
$ mv pg_dba_scripts-1.8.0/scripts ~/scripts
$ chmod 700 ~/scripts/*.sh
$ chmod 600 ~/scripts/settings.txt
```


## Setup

Modify file **settings.txt**. Uncomment and correct the entries for your current PostgreSQL version.
```
# PostgreSQL version
PG_VER=12						# Supported PostgreSQL versions: 9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13


# Red Hat / CentOS
#PG_BIN=/usr/pgsql-$PG_VER/bin				# Executables directory (by default, do not change!)

#PG_DATA=/var/lib/pgsql/$PG_VER/data			# Main data directory
#PG_ARC=/var/lib/pgsql/$PG_VER/archive			# Archive logs directory
#PG_LOG_DIR=/var/lib/pgsql/$PG_VER/data/log		# Directory for log files. For PostgreSQL 9.6 directory is /pg_log


# Debian
#PG_BIN=/usr/lib/postgresql/$PG_VER/bin			# Executables directory (by default, do not change!)

#PG_DATA=/var/lib/postgresql/$PG_VER/data		# Main data directory
#PG_ARC=/var/lib/postgresql/$PG_VER/archive		# Archive logs directory
#PG_LOG_DIR=/var/lib/postgresql/$PG_VER/data/log	# Directory for log files. For PostgreSQL 9.6 directory is /pg_log
```

### pg_database_activity

PostgreSQL monitoring script, all information is displayed on one page. Displays PostgreSQL version and status (Master / Replica), hostname and IP address, CPU and Disks load. Shows the sizes of the main PostgreSQL directories, archived logs and free disk space, swap usage. It also displays memory consumption by PostgreSQL processes, statistics on databases, waits and locks, archive and replication statuses. When activities occur in PostgreSQL, the progress of operations is displayed: vacuum, vacuum full or cluster, index creation, analyze, pg_basebackup. At the end, the last entries of the PostgreSQL log file are displayed. For ease of perception, information is displayed in color.

#### Setup:

Change the value of the PG_LOG_LINES parameter in the script, which is responsible for displaying the number of last lines of the PosgtreSQL log file.
```
PG_LOG_LINES=15		# Number of PostgreSQL log lines to display. 0 - disable output
```

#### Examples of work:

Running pgbench, 10 backend connections. WALSync wait and Row Exclusive locks. WalSender background processes consumes 19.3% and 24.2% CPU. Total CPU load 6.34 %.

![pg_database_activity1](media/db_activity_pgbench.png)


Vacuum full command executing with Access Exclusive lock. Replication lag appeared (total_lag 2721) on streaming and logical replication, archiving are not lagging behind (arc_diff 1). The size of Archive logs increased to 1.3 GB. WalSender background processes consumes 13.2% and 16.5% CPU, overall Disk load 9.73 %. The number of PostgreSQL log file entries has automatically decreased.

![pg_database_activity2](media/db_activity_vacuumfull.png)


Streaming replication to replica server. The server status is highlighted in a separate color, the type of replication (streaming), the slot used (node1_slot) and the lag in replication are shown.

![pg_database_activity3](media/db_activity_repstream.png)


Logical replication to the master PostgreSQL server 13.1. Subscription name (appdbsub) and replication lag (subscription_lag) are shown. Logical replication worker consumes 1.3% CPU.

### pg_database_information

A script that provides a single tape with the current status of a group of PostgreSQL servers, allowing you to quickly find out what the servers are doing and see the exact data for logical replication and external tables. Server time and lag time, hostname and IP address, PostgreSQL version and status (Master / Replica), data checksums are displayed. It also displays statistics on databases, waits and locks, archive and replication statuses. For logical replication, information about publications and subscriptions in the target databases is displayed. Displays information about external servers, associated users and tables. Blocked sessions and a tree with their locks are displayed, as well as a list of long-running requests. When activities occur in PostgreSQL, the progress of operations is displayed: vacuum, vacuum full or cluster, index creation, analyze, pg_basebackup.

#### Setup:

Modify the list of current PostgreSQL hosts in the script, or use the setting only for the local server (localhost). 
```
# Array of PosgtreSQL servers
declare -a servers_list=("localhost")					# Local server
#declare -a servers_list=("pg_server_1" "pg_server_2" "pg_server_3")	# Servers list, hostnames. Format: "pg_server_1" "pg_server_2" ...
```

#### Requirements:

- All PostgreSQL hosts must be network accessible. Check with **ping** command (using three servers as an example):
```
$ ping pg_server_1
$ ping pg_server_2
$ ping pg_server_3
```

- The PostgreSQL server must be allowed passwordless user **postgres** access. To do this, create a **~/.pgpass** file from the **postgres** user with the following content, substituting the current password for "password":
```
*:*:*:postgres:password
```

- Grant the necessary rights to **~/.pgpass** file
```
$ chmod 600 ~/.pgpass
```

- Checking the connection to databases of other PostgreSQL servers:
```
$ psql -h pg_server_1
$ psql -h pg_server_2
$ psql -h pg_server_3 
```

#### Example:

A cluster of three PostgreSQL servers. The first server (c7postgresql) runs PostgreSQL 12.5 and is the master for the second server. Logical replication is carried out from it, the publication of appdbpub in the appdb database with a dedicated slot is created. It also has access to external data of the third server, foreign server to host 192.168.1.198, appdb2 database, logs_fs.log_timeline table under the postgres user. The session blocking tree is visible when trying to update the same data. The second server (c7postgresql-1) is a replica, streaming replication from the first server is performed to it. There is a time lag of 2 seconds compared to the first server. The third server (c7postgresql-2) runs on PostgreSQL 13.1 and receives logical replication of the appdb database from the first server, the appdbsub subscription is configured. Two sessions with long running queries are displayed.
